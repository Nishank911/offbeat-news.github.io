  “People today are in danger of drowning in information; but, because they have been taught that information is useful, they are more willing to drown than they need be.
<br />
If they could handle information, they would not have to drown at all.”
<br />

<p>
The world today is progressing at an unprecedented rate.  The days of sitting at the breakfast counter, catching up with your daily newspaper are not as effective as it used to be.
<br>
<br>
The cosy ink-stained pages are now perceived as boring and replaced by monetarily inclined digital tabloids that now bombard you with information. 
<br>
<br>
Long gone are the days when you would have to wait patiently for updates that would be published in the periodicals the following day. Now, information is available at your fingertips, with enough content to fill a lifetime.

<p>
In this mishmash of information and constant influx, a pivotal point to focus on, as a consumer, is- Gathering information that suits your needs and draining out the news that does not interest you.
<br>
<br>
A question that arises here in response asks how we are supposed to go about following through on this effectively.
<br><br>
The first point to remember here is seeking out personalised content. With constantly developing algorithms, you now have the ability to pick and choose topics specific to your interests and wants, ridding yourself of the news that doesn’t concern you. This streamlines your content to be catered specifically for you. 
<br>
<br>
However, not all issues related to a specific category are equally demanding or insightful to everyone, collectively. To reiterate, the amount of content is exponential, even within a particular niche; and reading through every article can prove draining and disdainful. This is where some  news applications have progressed immensely. These applications now produce condensed summaries, drawn out from in-depth editorials that provide a glimpse into the depths of an article. These glances are beneficial, especially for two reasons. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
<p>
Firstly, by providing a gist of the article, it delivers a brief abstract of the information, enough to make you aware of a certain development.
<br />Secondly, if this glimpse piques your interest, you can easily redirect to the in-depth article to peruse its contents. 
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
As we have already seen, coping with this fast-paced world is not easy; rather it proves to be emotionally and physically draining. A remedy that a lot of people apply for such exhaustion is to cleanse any media from their diet. Many simply stop following the news entirely.
<br>
<br><br>

    </center>
<br><br>
<p>
As enticing as it may seem at first, following through on such a cleanse is not easy. Often, we have no choice but to throw ourselves into the world of media once again, the hiatus only makes us feel more overwhelmed when we re-emerge.
<br>
<br>
Most of us are responsible citizens of the world, and in today’s day and age, running away from the news will prove more challenging than ever. All we as consumers can do is follow a healthy, balanced, moderate diet- of information. It is necessary to take the good in along with the bad, for to believe there is only the negative is a sorrowful existence. The power of positive media, even when provided in the form of small snippets, is enough to inspire and uplift the most disheartened of minds.
<br>
</p>


<br>
<p>
So do not drown in the enormity of the news available. Instead, use the technology at your disposal to assist you in finding the content that you value; and allow it to help you sail leisurely across this sea of information.
