    <h3 style=" padding-bottom: 30px;"> Sensational news can be addictive. how to avoid this compulsive habit?</h3>
    <br /><br />
    <p>
    Sensational news catches public interest and causes great excitement. What makes the news staggering? The news, from startling headlines to the visuals used, is conceived to prey on our impulses to pay attention to the excitement and ferocity. The eerie presentation triggers dopamine in our brains making us crave more for pleasure. Despite the individual convictions, we are all drawn to it. How can this addictive behaviour harm us? Well, when it’s an addiction it’s no good. While knowledge is power, the sort of information fed to us creates an illusion making us believe that there is productivity to it.
    <br /><br />
    What is the output of this? Are we mind-numbingly scrolling news for 5 hours straight? Or are we gaining something from it?
    <br /><br />
    Many of us aren’t using the information in a positive way because we can’t find the silver lining to it, just emotional arousal. Consuming news isn’t bad but binging sensational news is. So, we are facing a predisposed addictive behaviour; some with games, some with social media and some with sensational news. How do we fight it?
    <br /><br />
    Well, the answer is not stopping the consumption of news. What we need is a strategy and some alternatives in order to associate our mind to positivity.

    When you find yourself glancing at your mobile for the sensational news, take a step back and get out of your home. If political news piques your interest, contact your local government and see if there is a way for you to contribute. If you are worried sick in the comfort of your home, there are always other options available for you like volunteering, social awareness and many more. It will not only help you feel like a better human but will also dispense insightful information to your end.

      One way to stop consuming sensational news is by spreading it. Often, the bad news is bound to reach our ear. When that happens, do not circle it around in your stories, feed or conversations. The less you spread unnecessary info, the less you care about it.
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <h5>8. Time Management</h5>

      Consume the news timely. After choosing positive and healthy news, read them for 15 minutes and switch off your social media, hyperlinks and other profiles to avoid spending more time on it. Honestly, there is no better time management method than this to get your wasted hours back.
      <br /><br />
      Studies have shown that watching too much negative news can trigger stress reactions. So the above options can help anyone maintain a healthy mind. Although the requirements differ individually, these points can be further altered to meet an individual’s lifestyle, taste and choices. That’s what is flexible about <i>Offbeat News;</i> it can put forward any unique requirements.
