    The essentials of having positivity around is something which has become even more importantly emphasised during this period of stringent lockdown. We need to understand the impact negative things and information around us occur. Taking the example of the daily uprise in the number of deaths and the mental health damage caused by the virus on a large level, we at Offbeat would want to underline the prime negative light news spreads around us.<br><br>
Mental health needs to be taken up seriously more so as constant exposure to negative surroundings around us, will for sure instil toxicity in us too. According to a study, it has been claimed that- Watching only 14 minutes of negative news increased anxiety, sadness, and the tendency to catastrophic a personal worry, according to a 2011 study by Psychologists Wendy M. Johnston and Graham C. L. Davey. Although we do realise that the news from the outside does take a huge toll on us and stresses us out further injecting stress and anxiety, still we cannot refrain ourselves from watching news. The main cause of this can be pointed out as absence of positive news which can actually delve in and make a noteworthy impact on us. Thus, the public and even youngsters especially turn themselves in to watching news which can damage their personality and the way in which they perceive the society.
<br><br>
The existing media for sure does take a toll on the mental health, no caps. Absence of filter from letting which news out has definitely caused the news channels and debate sectors to be a dumpland of mischievous and unsettling news broadcast. Living in the age of heavy advancements for technology, one needs to make sure that the mindset is proper and the exposure is appropriate.
<br><br>
Initially Coordinated to spread awareness amongst the masses, the new level unlocked by the media in general has taken a vivacious turn, which needs to be curbed. Thus, presenting pleasant news from around the globe and enlightening the masses with the knowledge apart from their niche too has become a part of our motif. For we firmly believe that positivity can conquer and shatter the darkness around us. We firmly believe that spreading positivity via news, can be a major help to the young minds and help them mould in a proper and a nourishing manner, thus helping the future of the globe flourish and thrive on positivity rather than negative and vivacious news.
